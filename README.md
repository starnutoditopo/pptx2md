## Installation & Usage

### Installation

You need to have _[Python](https://www.python.org/)_ with version later than __3.6__ and _pip_ installed on your system, then run in the terminal:

```sh
pip install pptx2md
```

### Usage

Once you have installed it, use the command `pptx2md [pptx filename]` to convert _pptx file_ into markdown.

The default output filename is `out.md`, and any pictures extracted (and inserted into .md) will be placed in `/img/` folder. 

__Note:__ older .ppt files are not supported, convert them to the new .pptx version first.

__Upgrade & Remove:__

```sh
pip install --upgrade pptx2md

pip uninstall pptx2md
```

## Custom Titles

By default, this tool parse all the pptx titles into `level 1` markdown titles, in order to get a hierarchical table of contents, provide your predefined title list in a file and provide it with `-t` argument.

This is a sample title file (titles.txt):

```
Heading 1
  Heading 1.1
    Heading 1.1.1
  Heading 1.2
  Heading 1.3
Heading 2
  Heading 2.1
  Heading 2.2
    Heading 2.1.1
    Heading 2.1.2
  Heading 2.3
Heading 3
```

The first line with spaces in the begining is considered a second level heading and the number of spaces is the unit of indents. In this case, `  Heading 1.1` will be outputted as `## Heading 1.1` . As it has two spaces at the begining, 2 is the unit of heading indent, so `    Heading 1.1.1` with 4 spaces will be outputted as `### Heading 1.1.1`. Header texts are matched with fuzzy matching, unmatched pptx titles will be regarded as the deepest header.

Use it with `pptx2md [filename] -t titles.txt`.

## Other Arguments 

* `-t [filename]` provide the title file
* `-o [filename]` path of the output file
* `-i [path]` directory of the extracted pictures
* `--image-width [width]` the maximum width of the pictures, in px. **If set, images are put as html img tag.**
* `--disable-image` disable the image extraction
* `--disable-escaping` do not attempt to escape special characters
* `--disable-wmf` keep wmf formatted image untouched (avoid exceptions under linux)
* `--disable-color` disable color tags in HTML
* `--min-block-size [size]` the minimum number of characters for a text block to be outputted
* `--wiki` / `--mdk` if you happen to be using tiddlywiki or madoko, this argument outputs the corresponding markup language

* **Left**: Source pptx file.
* **Right**: Generated markdown file (rendered by madoko).

## Detailed Parse Rules

* Lists are generated when paragraphs in a block has different level, otherwise a paragraph is generated.
* When a title has fuzzy matching score larger than 92 with previous title, its _omitted_.
* Some preset theme color style is converted into bold.
* RGB colors are preserved.
* Source texts are escaped.
* Grouped shapes are flattened recursively.
